Digit Image Recognition using Logistic Regression
This project demonstrates basic image recognition using the Digits dataset from Scikit-learn. It uses Logistic Regression, a simple yet effective machine learning model, to recognize handwritten digits from 8×8 grayscale images.

Dataset
Source: Scikit-learn built-in load_digits()
Images: 1,797 samples of digits (0–9)
Format: Each image is 8x8 pixels, flattened into 64 features
Tools & Libraries
Python
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Pandas
Methodology
